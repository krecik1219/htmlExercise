            <h4>Java description</h4>
            <div id="aboutLang">
                    Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
                    It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
                    Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming
                    languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been
                    acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level
                    facilities than either of them.
                <br><br>
                    The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the
                    specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these
                    Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).
                <br><br>
                    The latest version is Java 11, released on September 25, 2018, which follows Java 10 after only six months in line with the new release schedule. Java 8 is still supported but there will be no more
                    security updates for Java 9. Versions earlier than Java 8 are supported by companies on a commercial basis; e.g. by Oracle back to Java 6 as of October 2017 (while they still "highly recommend that
                    you uninstall" pre-Java 8 from at least Windows computers).

                    Using reflection mechanism you can access any filed, any method despite it is
                    public, protected or private. Be careful such a programming stands in opposite
                    to object oriented programming principles.

                    Even though java is memory auto-managed it doesn't mean you won't have memory leaks.
                    Sometimes is necessary to explicitly null some variables.

                    Java generics are not really generic. Feature is just compile time check to verify
                    programmer is using correct types, but at runtime each type defined as generic is
                    the narrowest possible type - often Object.
