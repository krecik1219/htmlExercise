            <h4>C description</h4>
            <p>
                C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended
                operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in
                assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has since become one of the most widely used
                programming languages of all time, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been
                standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
            </p>
            <p>
                C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs
                that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.
                A standards-compliant C program that is written with portability in mind can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.
                The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.
